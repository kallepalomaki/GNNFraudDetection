This is an experiment for financial fraud detection.

I have used simulated PaySim data obtained through the related Kaggle challenge.

PaySim simulator is available here.

I have done a quick comparison of graph based neural networks 2D convolutional and basic feedforward networks. This far I haven't done proper hyper parameter tuning or considered matching parameter space sized. 
The experiment was more to learn the financial fraud detection problem and graph based neural networks.
